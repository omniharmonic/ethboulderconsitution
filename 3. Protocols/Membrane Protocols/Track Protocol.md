**Purpose**: Establish clear governance structure for track membranes with semi-autonomous operation within ETHBoulder's constitutional framework.

**Initialization**: This protocol activates when track membranes are created, Track Leads are appointed, and budgets are allocated.

**Participants**: Steward Council creates and oversees track membranes; Track Leads manage track-level governance and programming; Operations, Tech, and Promotion teams provide support.

**Track Governance Structure**:
- Track Creation: Steward Council creates track membranes with defined scope and budget allocation
- Track Governance: Track Leads manage track-level decisions within approved scope and budget
- Budget Management: Track Leads manage allocated budget for venue, AV, VIP, and catering
- Coordination: Track Leads coordinate with other tracks and Steward Council for cross-track initiatives
- Reporting: Track Leads provide regular updates on programming, budget, and outcomes

**Autonomy & Accountability**: Tracks operate semi-autonomously within their approved scope and budget, but remain accountable to Steward Council for constitutional alignment and resource management.

**Track Closure**: Tracks may be closed by Steward Council for cause or completion, with proper transition planning and resource reallocation.
