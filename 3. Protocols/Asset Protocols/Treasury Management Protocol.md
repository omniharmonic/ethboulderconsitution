**Purpose**: Establish clear, tiered pathways for making and executing financial decisions from the ETHBoulder treasury with track-specific autonomy and accountability.

**Initialization**: The protocol activates when the treasury multisig is configured, stewards are credentialed, and track budgets are allocated.

**Participants**: Steward Council leads treasury execution; Track Leads manage track-specific budgets; Operations, Tech, and Promotion teams coordinate within their domains.

**Tiers & Approvals**: 
- Main Treasury: Steward Council manages shared funds via multi-sig with 3-of-5 threshold for major decisions
- Track Allocations: Pre-approved budgets distributed to Track Leads for venue, AV, VIP, and catering
- Ops Tier (< $1K): Track Lead discretion; direct execution from track allocation
- Mid-Tier ($1K-$10K): Track Lead + Steward Council advice; documented approval required
- Strategic Tier (> $10K): Steward Council consent + timelock for execution

**Transparency & Records**: All allocations, votes, and transactions are published with sufficient detail to enable auditability and community oversight. Post-event accounting reconciles allocations and actual expenditures.

**Track-Specific Management**: Each track receives allocated budget for venue, AV, VIP, and catering. Track Leads have autonomy within their allocation but must document expenditures and report to Steward Council.
