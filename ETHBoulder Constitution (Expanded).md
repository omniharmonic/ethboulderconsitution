| steps | Track Entry; Track Exit; Financial Expenditure; Cross-Track Coordination; Documentation |

Purpose: Provide clear, lightweight pathways for how decisions are made across ETHBoulder domains, balancing human discernment with transparency and accountability.

Initialization: This protocol activates at ETHBoulder launch when roles are credentialed and the Governance Forum is open for proposals, records, and votes.

Participants: Track Leads manage track-level decisions; Steward Council coordinates cross-track and strategic decisions; Operations, Tech, and Promotion teams execute within their domains.

Decision Domains & Flows

- Track Entry: Steward Council appoints Track Leads via consent process; Track Leads receive budget allocation and autonomy within scope
- Track Exit: Track Leads may step down with 30-day notice; Steward Council may remove for cause via consent process; transition plan required
- Financial Expenditure: 
  - Ops Tier (< $1K): Track Lead discretion; direct execution
  - Mid-Tier ($1K-$10K): Track Lead + Steward Council advice; documented approval
  - Strategic Tier (> $10K): Steward Council consent + timelock for execution
- Cross-Track Coordination: Steward Council facilitates; conflicts escalate to mediation
- Documentation: All decisions archived with context, budget impact, and execution status

Records & Transparency: Each decision links to forum context, evidence of consent/votes, and transaction hashes where relevant. Changelogs maintained for protocols and Constitution.

Safeguards: Clear thresholds, timelocks for high-stakes moves, revocability of delegated authority, and active conflict protocol protect against capture and support legitimacy.
